# Dynamic open graph images with HTML and CSS

Use this Laravel package together with [ogkit.js](https://github.com/petersuhm/ogkit.js) to add dynamically generated Open Graph images to your Laravel app with HTML and CSS.

## Requirements

This package uses [Spatie's Browsershot](https://spatie.be/docs/browsershot/v4/introduction) package for image generation, which requires [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/) to be installed. You can install it via npm:

```bash
npm install puppeteer
```
